Hello, world! Right now, I'm taking Harvard's CS50 intro to computer science class. Here's where I'll record my progress :). The unpaid version of the class I have does give assignments, but they're not graded. That's why I'm submitting them here. And, other people can look here if they need help with some of their CS50 assignments. 

Goals:
Understand other languages besides python
Have a good python foundation before I start learning AI stuff
Make some useful codes I can use in my everyday life (like picking which friend to talk to)
Think more like a coder in my everyday life
Finish it before the end of summer (but apparently it's supposed to take 12 weeks, and right now summer has 4 weeks left...but I'll try my best haha)

Here's the link to the free class via EdX: https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x?webview=false&campaign=CS50%27s+Introduction+to+Computer+Science&source=edx&product_category=course&placement_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.edx.org%2Fcs50
